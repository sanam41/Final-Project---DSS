This repository uses the Motion Sense dataset to build human activity recognition model using two approaches: Random Forest and Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (LSTM). 
It includeds a proposal, an EDA notebook as well as a notebook for RF and one for LSTM model. A powerpoint slide summarizes the findings and results.
